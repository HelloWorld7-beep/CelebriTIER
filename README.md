# CelebriTIER
COP3530 Project 3

Given actors, we want to find the shortest path of movies that connect the actors. This game has the same principle as the Wikipedia game where you go from one link to another by clicking links that link them. An example of this game is https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8Jo54CX/  Tiktok user @emma_and_luke created the game CelebriTIES that follows the same principle of the wikipedia game where we have to find the shortest connection from Object A to Object B through the links within the wikipedia page. Ex.Starting at the Apple(fruit) wikipedia page and going through the different links in the page to reach the Italy (country) wikipedia page. For this game, it would be two different actors. Letâ€™s say Actor A to Actor B. You would start off with an Actor A that stars in this film, find an actor in that film that connects another actor in another film until you find a path to Actor B.
